| December 2  |   2:35-3:00pm   | Well we can't shorten the radix like in DNA since we aren't guaranteed to have just the alphabet with some punctuation. We also can't do what we did in bitmap. I am starting about thinking about patterns that show up in text because that's what the problem set says. But I am confused because I don't know what patterns to find in text because its organic and not very pattern like. Maybe some words are repeated more than others and we can replace those with an escape character. But I feel that won't even get us even near 50%. |
| December 2  |   9:20-9:50pm   |                                                                                                                      I am now remembering back to the slides and how the algorithm gets better with size. I can't really guess a whole algorithm based off this but at least I think it has a log(n) or something runtime. I don't know how this will help but it's interesting none the less. I spent a lot of this time just thinking and thinking but I literally don't have anything else to write for it since I couldn't think of anything. |
| December 3  |   8:40-9:30pm   |      I am remembering something from class where I heard I think Hannah talking about hashing the text you told us she was almost there. I feel like it might take a while for the expanding part but then again we would like a better algorithm even if the time is a little more. Another idea I had was that you could hash the words and then check which words showed up the most by checking their hashes and make the word an escape code. But again this seems too inefficient and too simple. I am so confused about a pattern to find. |
| December 4  |   12:00-12:20   |                                                                                                                                                                                                    The last thing I am thinking of is reducing the amount of bits per char because smaller texts won't be reduced a lot but huge texts would be. Surely we aren't using all 256 characters right? But once again I feel like this solution is too simple and that I need to be more clever. What if it is graph theory- that would be pretty cool |

I was a little confused with when to use hex and decimal but Mr. Blick told me something very useful where it doesn't really matter as it was just for us to see better; remember computors only read binary anyway. |
| December 10 |    Classtime    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                I continued with compress() and after a little bit I had a skeleton of the function. The hardest part for me was figuring out the adding codes to the tst part. There was some math involved in how far ahead to move and stuff which confused me a little. I also realized I had to fill in the tst with the pre-existing values. |

But when I tried dump binary, it was actually adding 1 byte to the original instead of compressing. I figured that that byte was the EOF and that I wasn't actually doing any compressing. I figured that I had faulty logic when it came to writing out the codes. |

As a first step I reasoned out how the function would work and what steps needed to take place. I ignored the special case for now but I looked at the slides and how we expanded to get a better idea on how to implement and what variables I would need. I seemed pretty straightforward: I would write out codes from the map, add new codes to the map and then repeat. |

I seemed to get to a point where everything was working and I could now tackle the edge case. |

Eventually I got it to work after consulting the slides and thinking about why it happens and what I need to change after said thing happens. |
